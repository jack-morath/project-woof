			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>German Shepherds were originally bred in Germany for the purpose of herding and protecting flocks from predators. Many different dogs were bred, but in 1899 Max von Stephanitz found a dog that fulfilled what he believed a working dog should be. After purchasing the dog von Stephanitz named him Horand von Grafrath, who was officially the first German Shepherd. The UK Kennel Club first accepted registration for the breed in 1919 with 54 registered dogs. By 1926 the number grew to over 8,000 when the first German Shepherds arrived in the United States. In the 1930s the popularity of the German Shepherd saw a decline with the outbreak of World War 2 but since then has steadily climbed to the second most popular dog in the U.S. as of 2009.
